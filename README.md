# CineTrack

CineTrack is an iOS app created for an assignment in a university course. The idea is a movie and TV show watchlist app which uses TMDb to get information about movies. The app will support multiple watchlists, adding and deleting items, and showing information about watchlist entries including genre, description, runtime and/or other pieces of information. It will also potentially support accounts and a friendslist with the ability to compare watchlists with friends to find common entries.
